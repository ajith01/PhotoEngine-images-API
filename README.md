# PhotoEngine-images-API
A REST API that allows users to submit links of images with falling into various categories, which can be later queried by other users to use as placeholder images. The users can perform basic CRUD operations on the databases using the API.  A user must sign up to post and update their images, but the images can be used without signing up. 

This API is written in NodeJS using express library to make the web application to handle the HTTP requests. MongoDB is used as the database to store the links to the images and user information. 

The API is secured using bcrypt for passwords and jsonwebtokens (JWT) is used to presist login sessions rather than cookies.
